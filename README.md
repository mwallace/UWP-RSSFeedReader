# UWPTestApp
UWP RSS Feed Reader

This started as a quick and dirty app for learning UWP...a hello world that explored data binding. For some reason which nobody can explain, it then grew into an RSS feed reader. 
Maybe it seemed like a good fit for two-way data binding, maybe it was just a random choice my brain burped up out of the clear blue sky.
